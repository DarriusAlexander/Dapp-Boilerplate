# Boilerplate for app && Dapp
### Synapsis
Full speed Ahead for internet 3.0 and Blockchain Interopability.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The Dapp-Boilerplate boilerplate integrates uPort and Firebase. In other words cloud resources, application permissions and other identity related features can be administrered from the uPort Self-Sovereign Identity Systems and deployed within Google's Firebase (Infrastructure as a Service).

```
git clone https://github.com/efichot/Dapp-Boilerplate

yarn

```
**Distributed Autonomous Management System**
The Boilerplate aims to solve the challenge of starting a dapp or a app where you need to manage, organize and facilitate a large distributed network of people.

**This project will grow over time**
As of right now, the primary objective is to refine the user interface

## How it's Built
The Frontend is primary built in React, Redux and Redux Saga.
The Backend is built primary with Firebase.

1. Atomic Design Philosophy
2. Component/Container Separation
3. Functional State Management

## How It Works
1. Login With uPort
2. Attest Firebase UID
3. Request Application Permissions
